# Online_Flexibility

## This analysis is based on data collected on some Student's flexibility online for studies.
## The variables provided for this analysis are; Education Level, Institution Type, Gender Age,	
## Device, IT Student, Location, Financial Condition, Internet Type, Network Type and Flexibility Level.

# The aim of this project is to find how students adapted to online studies.

# Data Preparation
## The data contains a lot of data about students, it does not contain any personal information like emails 
## or names or any unique data that can distinguish each student. Therefore deleting duplicates might leave a 
## limited amount of data to be analyzed.
## Delete null values if there are any. 

# Data Analysis and Visualization
## Plotted directly related variables such as location and network type.
## Institution type and financial condition.
## Comparing gender and age.
## Education level and where a student studies IT or not.
## Type of device used.  

# Interpretation
## Males relatively have a higher online flexibility compared to females.  
## From the visualization, students in towns using mobile data have averagely higher flexibility than those using
## WiFi and mobile data in rural areas.
## From the visualization, students in towns with 4G access have averagely higher flexibility than those with
## 2G and 3G access in rural areas.
## From the visualization, students in private institutions and are in the mid financial condition category have
## averagely higher flexibility than students in public institutions with rich and low financial condition.
## From the visualization, students who do IT and are in universities have averagely higher flexibility than 
## students in schools and colleges.
## Students' who use mobile phones also have higher flexibility than those using computer and tablet, this might
## be due to how easy the mobile phone is carry around and ability to take courses anywhere.

# Recommendations
## To get a relatively higher online flexibility students should access their learning materials from phones.
## They should also live in towns with good connectivity(4G).
## Students should also take one or two IT courses to be familiar with their online portals or workspace.
## They should also reduce using shared networks such as Wi-Fi to improve connectivity.
